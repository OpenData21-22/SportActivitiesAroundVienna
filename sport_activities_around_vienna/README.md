# Sport activities in Vienna
Project members: Paul Renkel, Kaya LÃ¶her

## Idea
This project aims to give you information about all sport activities/places that are in Vienna.
Therefore we use data from wien.gv.at:
- TO-DO include dataset

## Technologies
We use Javascript to load and work with the provided JSON Data and PHP to persist the data.

## How to use this app
This javascript application is easy to use:
- install node modules via ``npm i``
- configure your webserver
- call ``npm start``
- open your browser on localhost:8080
- filter for the wanted sport activity

## Further plans
This project can be however still be improved:
- the dataset needs still some cleanup
- the filtering methods can be expanded
- you can export it in a docker container or any other to make it easier to access

## project collaboration
We worked with pair programming.
